This project contains sample apps that I've written as I'm learning Sproutcore and testing out concepts.

As of 7/9/2010, the code has been built to work with abbot and the master branch of Sproutcore.
For configuration instructions, see http://wiki.sproutcore.com/Abbot-Setting+Up under the section
"Getting the Latest Code".


route-sample
============
I found the standard Sproutcore route sample too complex for a newbie like me.
It uses responders, states and other advance features.

This sample demonstrates:
  - registering routes (in main.js) using SC.routes.add().
  - moving between 2 pages (one_page and two_page) using routes using SC.routes.set().
  - how to read and use URL parameters in the route handler (route.js)

login-sample
============
This demonstrates:
  - moving from one page to another
  - binding between view and controller
  - using 'view-model' data stored in the controller
  - async HTTP call to retrieve login details
  - error handling

This does NOT handle cookies, session id or logout.  This is will addressed in an the login-logout-sample (todo).

login-logout-sample
===================
This demonstrates:
  - using cookies to store authentication token upon login
  - storage of login permanently, for browser session or for 3 seconds
  - logout clearing authentication token
